A roguelike dealing with the great world of smörrebröd and öl

It's the year 2015, and Denmark has finally decided to retake the long lost rich region of Scania from Sweden. 
The Danish army, Hæren, sends their elite fighters, the Jægerkorpset, to invade the Scanian capital of Malmö. The invasion is 
planned for the first saturday i November. Due to hangovers the team is accidentally sent to the highly fortified Turning Torso 
instead of Länsstyrelsen.
